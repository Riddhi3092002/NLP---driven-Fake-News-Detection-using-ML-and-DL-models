# Project Overview
  This project aims to create a robust system for detecting false news using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. 

  1. Dataset Used : ISOT dataset containing a fair mix of factual and false news stories taken from credible news providers and identified fake news sites.
  2. Data Preprocessing:
       i. Removing punctuation and stopwords
      ii. Tokenization and lowercasing of text data
  3. Feature Extraction:
       i. TF-IDF Vectorization
      ii. GloVe word Embeddings
  4. Models Trained:
       i. Machine Learning Models
           a. Logistic Regression
           b. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
           c. Random Forest
           d. Multinomial Naive Bayes
      ii. Deep Learning Models
           a. Simple Neural Network
           b. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
           c. Bidirectional LSTM
           d. CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM)
           e. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
   5. Evaluation Metrics
       i. Accuracy
      ii. Precision
     iii. Recall
      iv. F1 Score
      
# Results
The models were evaluated on their ability to classify news articles as real or fake. The evaluation metrics for each model are provided in the project report.
