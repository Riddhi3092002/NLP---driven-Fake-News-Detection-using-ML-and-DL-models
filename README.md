  This repository contains the code and report for the Fake News Detection project.

## Project Files
   - `Fake News Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for the project.
   - `FakeNewsDetectionProjectReport.pdf`: Detailed project report including methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Project Overview
  This project aims to create a robust system for detecting false news using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. 

  ### 1. Data Preprocessing
  - **Dataset Used**: ISOT dataset containing a fair mix of factual and false news stories taken from credible news providers and identified fake news sites.
  - **Preprocessing Steps**:
    - Removing punctuation and stopwords
    - Tokenization and lowercasing of text data
  
  ### 2. Feature Extraction:
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
  - GloVe word Embeddings

  ### 3. Models Trained:
  - **Machine Learning Models**:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Random Forest
    - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - **Deep Learning Models**:
    - Simple Neural Network
    - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
    - Bidirectional LSTM
    - CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM)
    - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)

  ### 4. Evaluation Metrics
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
      
## Results
The models were evaluated on their ability to classify news articles as real or fake. The evaluation metrics for each model are provided in the project report.
